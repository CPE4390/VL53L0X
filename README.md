# VL53L0X  

Laser rangefinder with true time of flight measurment.  
Uses the manufacturer supplied API with platform specific code added by me.  
I2C interface tested with a PIC18F87J11  

## Suggested improvements/additions  
* Make use of the interrupt pin  
* Lots of API functions that could be used/tested  
* Application suggestions - motion detection, etc.
